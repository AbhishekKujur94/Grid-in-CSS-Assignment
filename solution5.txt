justify-items:
-justify-items property defines how grid items are aligned along the inline (row) axis within their grid area.
-It applies to the grid container and affects all grid items within it.
-This property aligns grid items along the row axis within their respective grid cells.

Example:

.grid-container{
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: auto auto;
  justify-items: center;
}
.grid-item{
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 20px;
}

In this example, all grid items within the grid container will be centered along the row axis.


justify-self:
-justify-self property defines how a single grid item is aligned along the inline (row) axis within its grid area.
-It applies directly to individual grid items and overrides the justify-items property for that specific item.
-This property allows you to control the alignment of a particular grid item within its grid cell.

Example:

.grid-container{
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: auto auto;
}
.grid-item{
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 20px;
  justify-self: end;
}

In this example, only the grid item with the class .grid-item will be aligned to the end of its grid cell along the row axis, regardless of the justify-items value set for the grid container.
